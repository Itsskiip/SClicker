# SClicker
A Autohotkey script to automate mouseclicks when the mouse has stopped moving.

SClicker.ini has to be present in the same folder for this version to work.

Modify SClicker.ini to change the settings:
- Wait time - how long the mouse has to remain stationary before a click is registered (in milliseconds)
- Polling time - how often the script checks for movement (in milliseconds)
- Hotkey to toggle
